{"entries":[{"id": 1, "title":"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth...","content":"21-year-old Indian in Finland, studying in TUT (now TAU) and working for Kii/Ainak Oy as a Project manager. <br/><br/> Embarking on the journey to master the skill of writing by starting a blog.<br/> I will be writing about topics ranging from software programming to cooking to notes by exalted guest lectures to Culture in Finland.<br/><br/> I am hoping to make 2019 a learning year. I am a big fan of learning skills and I (try to) do so regularly. But reflecting back, 2018 was a bit short on the expectation. It was still an excellent year, with a great many events and travels (My best year so far) but if I examine what new skills I learned, then the list doesn’t start growing.<br/><br/> In 2019, I plan to develop myself in both, soft skills, and hard skills.<br/> Soft skills include better writing(this blog), better communication with people, team management techniques (by implementing them in my work) and better time management.<br/> Hard skills encompass learning Web development (full stack) and graphic design.<br/><br/> Getting yourself to write every day is quite difficult and impractical, to be honest. That’s why I’ve decided to write every Wednesday one article and edit (format or whatever you call it) during Thursday.<br/> About other skills that I’m planning to learn, I haven’t made any specific plan for them yet. At least not for other soft skills but for Hard skills, I’ve started a project (I'll write more about it later) because learning by doing is by far the most effective way for me.<br/> Once I’m good with Web development skills (which will take some time, especially front end), then I’ll move to Graphic design. I might even take some proper courses in summer, to actually get into the artistic zone for graphic design.<br/><br/> Yeah Yeah, I know this is somewhat typical “New year resolution or new year new me” stuff but I think it’s beneficial in long term.<br/> Bad image for these “This year is going to be my learning year” is because people can’t keep up the promise they made to themselves.<br/> Now I have a healthy pressure to keep up, otherwise, I’ll be just one of those people (And I’d hate that very much).<br/><br/> So in the end, It can go either of two way. Either I'll get lazy and forget about the whole thing and go back to my normal schedule, then so be it. Or I'll stick to my commitment and actually get better at stuff that I only fancy about getting good at (especially when browsing through Dribbble and thinking how are these people so creative?!?).<br/><br/> <i>“Insanity is doing the same thing, over and over again, but expecting different results.”</i> - Albert Einstein<br/>"},
            {"id": 2, "title":"The measure of a man is his state of mind...", "content": "It requires 10000 hours to master a skill. <br/> However truthful the number might be, but general idea valid. It takes practice, experience, and repetitions to develop a skill. Beethoven didn't compose the fifth symphony the first time he put his hands on a piano. <br/> <br/> <br/> The world has moved to service-based industries where most of the value provided by a company is due to its employees rather than the product itself. <br/> Some would argue that the success of Apple, Google, Microsoft, and other giants is because they hire the best of best.<br/> <br/> Some more Non-Billion-dollar Finnish companies come to my mind when thinking about this topic. <br/> Gofore and Vincit, these two are well-known software companies in Finland and both of them focus on making their brand \"Cool place to work\".<br/> It is an interesting phenomenon because this brand image wouldn't directly give them an advantage in actually selling their services or products but it indirectly conveys the message that \"We have most talented people working with us, so you can guess how good products we have\".<br/> <br/> Having the best talent working for you is only possible if you can filter them out from a huge pile of candidates.<br/> <br/> This problem becomes increasingly difficult when we start to move from hard skills to soft skills. <br/> If you're a hospital looking for best surgeons, you will probably filter the candidates out from how many successful surgeries they have performed and what university they got their doctorate from. <br/> <br/> Now let's say you're hiring a UX Designer, it gets a bit trickier because you can't just rely on their degree at all. Previous projects become the main driver but quantifying them isn't as easy as counting the number of successful bypass surgeries. <br/> <br/> What about self-taught designers who aren't top notch now but their rate of learning or improvement is amazing? missing out on this talent would hurt, won't it?<br/> <br/> And when you're hiring a primary school teacher, things suddenly become even worse because there is no driver that can convey the level of skills in handling kids and teaching them basics of probably everything that they'll learn in their life.<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> The grass is not so much greener on the other side. <br/> As difficult as it is for recruiters to filter out good talent, it's also very difficult for people to demonstrate their skills. <br/> I think the main reason for it is that \"Selling yourself\" or using more appropriate terms \"Demonstrating your skills\" is also a skill. A very important one indeed.<br/> <br/> This skill of demonstrating your skills bring little value to most of the workplaces. I agree that it might be useful in some areas like sales and upper-level leadership but for a large spectrum, it brings little value. <br/> <br/> So the importance of it is little and it is the highest impacting skills in the decision whether you'll work at your dream place. <br/> <br/> This situation requires some solution that can address the problems and I will discuss it in another post. <br/> <br/> Till then, <br/> <br/> <i>“Life is like a tango; fortunate are the few who can master it.” </i><br/> ― A.J.

            {"id": 3, "title":"Earth is round...", "content": "\"I'll make you travel the world\" was the sequence of words that you could often hear coming out from my mouth to my parents when I was a kid. <br/> <br/> I'm sure that they were received in the same way as when a kid says \"I want to be an astronaut or a president\". They didn't completely disregard it because everything is possible but they knew it's highly unlikely, yet still nod the head and go along with it to keep me excited. <br/> <br/> For me, it was absolutely certain. <br/> There were many things I would say that even I knew isn't possible. But this one was not one of them. <br/> I didn't know when but I knew I will. Sooner the better. <br/> <br/> And soon it was. <br/> I finally started the delivery of my childish promise on 13th March 2019. It started with Rome and Venice. <br/> <br/> I do not, yet, have the skills to describe the beauty of these cities. I can just say that they were magically beautiful. Imagine the most beautiful place you've been to and the narrow streets from Piazza di Trevi in Rome are twice as beautiful. <br/> Pizzerias in every corner serving better pizza than the last one. it is not possible to roam around the city with an empty stomach. 5€ wine bottle from a supermarket might be the best wine you've ever tasted.<br/> On the other hand, Venice has its own charm. You would hear that it's the most unique city in the world and you even might agree with it but you would not actually understand the meaning of that unless you visit Venice. <br/> Not much to do other than aimlessly wandering in streets and crossing small bridges over narrow canals hoping to find the grand canal to orient yourself. But you wouldn't even want to do anything else. <br/> <br/> Now, framed as a gift to parents, it was also a great opportunity for me. Not only these cities are beautiful but they also hold thousands of years of history. and I love the places that have historic importance.<br/> <br/> Traveling there with parents also had one more upside. I was borderline obsessed with providing them with an enjoyable and knowledgeable experience. Making them walk through Vatican museums and climbing floors of Colosseum cluelessly wouldn't accomplish that. <br/> So, I had to dig considerably deep inside the history of the places we were going to visit. Spending hours watching documentaries and reading about Colosseum, History of Vatican city, and the importance of Venice gave me extra joy or further intrigued me when I visited those places. I intend to do this kind of homework before going on my future trips. <br/><br/> I would recommend people to consider giving trips as a gift to their parents. Experiences and memories are long preserved and most joyful. isn't that what you want in your gift?<br/> It is expensive, but the significance of the experiences can't be measured on the paper notes.<br/> It was a magnificent experience for my folks and in return, it gave me very much pleasure. <br/> Of course, I learned what I have to do differently for their future trips. Direct flights to the destination and hotels close to the city center is a must among other small things. <br/> I might not be with them on their future trips but even sitting at home while they enjoy some part of this beautiful world would give me great satisfaction. <br/> <br/> I will remember my promise as a kid and keep them traveling the world.<br/> <br/><br/> <i>“Traveling – it leaves you speechless, then turns you into a storyteller.”</i><br/> – Ibn Battuta "}
